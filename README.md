# Basic-HTML-example
This is very basic HTML code, you can copy and paste it, or download it and use it as your website. You WILL need a Text editor like Sublime Text to write more code and check errors though,

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<!-- Declare it's an HTML File -->
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="favicon.png">
    <title>Title</title>
    <!-- Set the Icon and the Title -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Header</h1>
    <p>Content</p>
    <!-- Show the content of the page, A header and content -->
  </body>
</html>
```
